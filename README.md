Red.Net(dotnetcore)
===================
dotnetcore utility classes and extension methods

The best code is no code at all, ofcourse if we don't write any code we also can't ship any features.
That's why we should aim to write as little code as possible. This library aims to provide a set of 
tools allowing to do more with less code.

This library offers:
--------------------
- Simplified data access
  - as extension methods on IDbConnection
  - as ActiveRecord-like ORM objects
  - with non-sql based searches
- Structured string placeholder replacement
- Sanity enforcement
- t4 like templating
- ... whatever I'll be needing next
